## Game Changer Rules

- First Principles Thinking – Instead of relying on conventional wisdom, true experts break problems down to their fundamental truths and rebuild solutions from the ground up. This allows them to innovate where others only iterate.
   * Example: Elon Musk rethinking battery costs by questioning material costs instead of market prices.
- Knowing What NOT to Do – Amateurs chase everything, while experts know what’s a waste of time. Knowing what not to focus on is just as powerful as knowing what to focus on. 
   * Example: In software engineering, a seasoned architect knows which features will cause tech debt years later.
- Mastering the 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle) – Experts understand that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts and optimize their focus accordingly.
   * Example: In cloud optimization, a few key services often drive the majority of cost savings.
- Intuition Built on Experience – Experts can "feel" when something is wrong or right because they've seen patterns so many times that they instinctively predict outcomes.
   * Example: A senior Kubernetes engineer can troubleshoot cluster failures in minutes because they’ve seen all the failure patterns before.
- Understanding the Invisible Forces – Experts see the underlying mechanics driving a system, whether it’s human psychology, market dynamics, or system design.
   * Example: A great engineer doesn’t just write code but understands the why behind architecture decisions.
